Appium Automation Tests
This repository is a fork of my mentor's original project, extended with additional automated tests for both Android and web platforms using Appium .

Overview
The project focuses on:

Android Application Testing : Automated UI tests for mobile applications.
Web Testing : Automated tests for web interfaces using Appium.
I have contributed by adding new test cases and enhancing the existing framework to ensure comprehensive coverage of key functionalities.

Key Tools and Technologies
Appium : For automating mobile and web interactions.
Python : As the primary language for writing test scripts.
Selene : A user-friendly wrapper around Selenium for browser automation.
pytest : For running and managing test cases.
