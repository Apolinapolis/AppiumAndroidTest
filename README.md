# Appium Automation Tests

This repository is a fork of my mentor's original project, extended with additional automated tests for both Android and web platforms using **Appium**.

## Overview

The project focuses on:
- **Android Application Testing**: Automated UI tests for mobile applications.
- **Web Testing**: Automated tests for web interfaces using Appium.

I have contributed by adding new test cases and enhancing the existing framework to ensure comprehensive coverage of key functionalities.

## Key Tools and Technologies
- **Appium**: For automating mobile and web interactions.
- **Python**: As the primary language for writing test scripts.
- **Selene**: A user-friendly wrapper around Selenium for browser automation.
- **pytest**: For running and managing test cases.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Apolinapolis/AppiumAndroidTest.git
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the tests
   ```bash
   pytest tests/



This fork includes my custom test implementations, which expand the original functionality. Feel free to explore, use, or contribute to the project!
